image process code
Denoising hyperspectral images (HSI) is a key preprocessing process for subsequent HSI applications. This project uses Transformer architecture for non local spatial self attention and global spectral self attention, two attention mechanism modules that process images in spatial and spectral aspects respectively
Project implementation based on the article "Spatial Spectral Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Denoising"
